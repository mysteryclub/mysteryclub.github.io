<p>Here is a sketch of characters from my comic <strong>Mystery Club</strong> their names are <strong>Pinky Rock</strong> and <strong>Relte.&nbsp;</strong>I’m don’t think there’s all that much to say about this sketch so I’m just going to speak a little about the characters.</p>
<p><strong>Pinky Rock</strong>&nbsp;is the character on the right, she is a rock star, she calm, intelligent and cool.</p>
<p><strong>Relte&nbsp;</strong>is the other character she is cheeky, sometimes sweet (or at least, pretends to be) and she is flirty.</p>
<p>I don’t think I really have anything else to say so, see ya soon (hopefully…?)</p>

His name is <strong>Saffron&nbsp;</strong>the woman in the middle is <strong>Pinky Rock&nbsp;</strong>and the little clingy maniac is <strong>Amy Abnobotchi.&nbsp;</strong>They are all very confident characters so I thought I would draw them altogether! The 2 characters on the right are both rock stars and the child would love to be a rock star so they also all have this in common!</p>
<p>I also just really enjoy drawing <strong>Amy</strong> and <strong>Pinky</strong> together, I think of them almost as sisters (though they’re not related) <strong>Pinky</strong> as the cool yet kind older sister and Amy as the immature younger sister who really looks up to her older sister.</p>
<p>In this illustration<strong> Amy&nbsp;</strong>is almost being ignored by <strong>Pinky&nbsp;</strong>but that is only for comedic purpose, in the comic <strong>Pinky</strong>&nbsp;is actually very good with <strong>Amy&nbsp;</strong>and makes her feel included!</p>
<p><strong>Saffron</strong> is yet to appear in the comic but when he does appear you will find out that he is friends with <strong>Pinky.</strong></p>
<p>Alright I think that’s all I have to say about this sketch! see ya soon (hopefully…?)</p>

<p>Right, in this post I want to talk a bit about <strong>Dekko Comics&nbsp;</strong>and their launch party and how I am involved with the company. So <strong>Dekko</strong> Comics is a comic book aimed at children as an alternative way to help them learn. The creator of <strong>Dekko</strong> is a man called <strong>Rossie Stone.</strong></p>
<p>Alright now that you know what <strong>Dekko</strong> is, I will start from the beginning and explain how I met <strong>Rossie.&nbsp;</strong>A few months ago I was at spring <strong>Rai-con, &nbsp;</strong>I had a stall and I was selling my comic book <strong>Mystery Club,&nbsp;</strong>Rossie was also at <strong>Rai-con</strong>, to be honest I’m not sure is he was selling his book there or not (I can’t remember). Anyway, at one point during the convention I was away, ( probably eating…eating marshmallows…. WHAT?!! THEY WERE SELLING GOURMET MARSHMALLOWS <strong>HOW WAS I MEANT TO RESIST?!!!!&nbsp;</strong>) And my mum was keeping an eye on my stall ’cause I do not have employees…</p>
<p>So when my mum was watching my stall I think <strong>Rossie</strong> came up to the stall and said he would come back later and buy my comic. Later on when I came back my mum told me but we didn’t actually think he would be back, but he was!</p>
<p>He bought all 4 of my books (I only had 4 books out at the time) <strong>Mystery Club Festival, Mystery Club Invisible Ink, Mystery club The Spy</strong> and <strong>Mystery Club Meet Miss ROCK! </strong>I think he gave me his business card and I happened to have forgot to bring any business cards so I just gave him my email address…..</p>
<p>A few weeks later we meet up for coffee, well I had tea ’cause tea’s better, AM I RIGHT?!! We spoke about my comic and how I got started which is a subject I may want to speak about in another post. What I didn’t exactly realise though was that this was a sort of job interview! At the end he asked me if I would like to possibly work for<strong> Dekko.</strong></p>
<p>Before working for <strong>Dekko</strong> there are 3 stages, the 1st is copying pictures of <strong>Dekko&nbsp;</strong>characters, the 2nd is coming up with poses for the characters and drawing that and the 3rd is drawing some <strong>Dekko</strong> comic strips. Right now I am actually still on the 1st step but I am close to moving on to step 2 so I am not officially working for them now but hopefully I soon will be!</p>
<p>As I said, I am not officially working for them at the moment, but I was still invited &nbsp;to the launch party for their 3rd volume and was given a stall to sell my books at!! It was a very fun night and I also met some of the other <strong>Dekko</strong>&nbsp;artists, listened to some very wonderful, inspirational talks, and sold out all my comics!!!</p>
<p>There should hopefully be some videos and photos from the night on <strong>Dekkos</strong> Facebook soon if you are interested so hopefully you can check that out!!</p>
<p><strong>Phew!</strong>&nbsp;That was a lot of writing! <em>Alrighty~ </em> see ya in ma next post (hopefully…)</p>

<p>Right, okay! I know this is the stupidest blog post possible to post but ya know what, this is my stupid blog and it can be as stupid as stupidly possible so let’s get on with the stupidity!</p>
<p>So yeah, you know when you look up your name…(you do that don’t you?! I know you do it , IT CAN’T JUST BE ME!!! Can it…?)</p>
<p>Anyway when you look up your name you do <strong>not&nbsp;</strong>want to find a picture like this! <strong>THIS IS WHAT A CONVENTION DOES TO YOU, CHILDREN!!!</strong> THIS IS WHAT IT DOES…!</p>
<p>P.s. This was taken at Rai-con, it was getting late, I was having to pose for pictures, some kind of weird animal just had to chose my head to crawl on to to die but despite that it was <strong>so</strong> enjoyable!</p>
<p>I met many other comic book artists and writers and I also met Rossie Stone who has his own business called <strong>Dekko comics</strong> (I might speak more about that in another post) anyway if you have wrote a comic or made artwork or something similar, seriously, try and get a stall at a convention or even just go to a convention! You will meet so many people who can help you there!</p>
<p>Right, I think that’s enough rambling now…see ya in my next post! (hopefully…?)</p>

		<p>Okay, I am a massive Fantastic Beasts fan seriously I even have the script and I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve read it but all you have to know is I’ve read it to many times. Anyway what was i gonna say…..yeah, I’ve also drawn my fair share of fan art but this sketch is different I decided to draw some characters from my comic <strong>Mystery Club</strong> as characters from the film! Right so i’m going to try and explain who is meant to be who so wish me luck!</p>
<p>The character at the front with the suit case is <strong>Professor Loco&nbsp;</strong>he is meant to be <strong>Newt.</strong></p>
<p>The girl to the right is called&nbsp;<strong>Amy Abnobotchi&nbsp;</strong>and she is meant to be <strong>Tina.</strong></p>
<p>The lovely &nbsp;little weirdo in the pink outfit is <strong>Pooty&nbsp;</strong>and he is dressed as <strong>Queenie.</strong></p>
<p>The grump in the second row to the left is<strong> Tiger&nbsp;</strong>and he is&nbsp;being&nbsp;<strong>Graves</strong></p>
<p>and the person next to him is&nbsp;<strong>Relte&nbsp;</strong>who is meant to be <strong>Credence.</strong></p>
<p>Finally the woman at the back is <strong>Pinky Rock&nbsp;</strong>who is <strong>Madam Picquery.</strong></p>
<p>Sigh…. that took a while…and honestly I would be</p>
<p>shocked if anyone actually bothered to read any of it!</p>
