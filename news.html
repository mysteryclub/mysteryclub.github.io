Oh you know, just the usual, meeting the leader of a country ‘n’ giving her a comic I made! 
Wow! Pretty insane and amazing, I was invited to the Year of Young People end of year event and I had the pleasure of meeting the first minister of Scotland there, it was incredible! <strong>I was asked to design a poster for the First Minister which will be hung in the Scottish Parliament. </strong></p>

            <p>Mystery Club is set in a surreal world in which sole human girl Amy Abnobotchi shares a tree house with a host of anthropomorphic animals, including “renegade scientist” Professor Loco and the manipulative Tiger Streak.

           <h2>Ben M. author of the 'Ozzy The Dog' book series reviews the Mystery Club</h2>
           
           <p>My name is Ben M. I am a young self-published Scottish author (just like you!) of the 'Ozzy The Dog' book series (my website: <a href="http://benmauthor.simplesite.com" target="_blank">http://benmauthor.simplesite.com</a>), I recently purchased your first graphic novel/comic 'Mystery Club: Festival' and just finished reading it. I would like to leave with you my review of the book and would like to ask if you could review my book also (the e-book version): <a href="https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/718104" target="_blank">https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/718104</a> Mystery Club - Festival by Amy Tucker</p>



<p>I am a massive fan of comic books such as Adventure Time and The Simpsons and upon browsing A1 Toys store recently I came upon Mystery Club - Festival by Amy Tucker. Amy Tucker is an artist I had never heard about before and the comic sounded and looked fantastic so I purchased it! I do not regret anything.</p>


<p>Mystery Club - Festival is a hillarious comic about a girl named Amy Abnobotchi, who is ten years old. Amy doesn't live in our world though, instead one where animals can talk! She lives with a scientist named Professor Loco and they travel to a festival where different clubs meet, meeting a very cute cat and a mysterious tiger.</p>


<p>When reading the book I couldn't help but think of it as an anime-like version of Adventure Time mixed with a little bit of Alice In Wonderland (cats, caterpillars!) which is great! The story is absolutely bonkers which is what makes the comic so funny and original. The artwork is outstanding... what's even more outstanding though is the fact that this comic was drawn and written by... a 12 year old girl (my age!) and is better than some of the big-name comics currently on shelves.</p>


<p>Overall, Mystery Club - Festival is a highly recommended (bonkers!) read for children of all ages which is sure to put a smile on your face!</p>


<p>Mystery Club - Festival gets *****!</p>


<p>Yours Sincerely,<br>
Ben.</p>

           <p><strong>The following review is taken from the <a href="https://bigcomicpage.com/2017/03/31/ceej-says-mystery-club-vol-1-4-review/" target="_blank">bigcomicpage.com</a></strong></p>
            <p>Self-published series “Mystery Club” introduces us to Amy Abnobotchi, a ten-year-old girl living in a fantastical world alongside aliens, talking animals and other curious characters of all shapes and sizes.  Throughout the course of these four volumes, we get to see Amy and her  rather odd group of friends (and frenemies) attending the world famous ‘Club Festival’, meeting celebrities and doing their best to solve any mysteries they stumble upon.  It’s charming, fun and lively throughout, and it’s easy to see the enthusiasm of its creator – twelve year old Amy Tucker – bursting through in practically every page.</p>

<p>Let’s face it, most of us will have doodled some crazy characters on scraps of paper in our time, and some of us may have even taken the time to come up with little stories featuring them.  But for a twelve-year-old to put such an incredible amount of effort into creating not one, not two, not three but four volumes of this series makes me, a lifelong comic book fan, feel all warm and fuzzy inside.  Oh, and a little bit ashamed that I didn’t have the work ethic to do something similar myself when I was younger.</p>

<p>Younger readers will get a kick out of the humour on display here, with grumpy, comically violent Amy reacting badly to any perceived criticism or doubting of her “cuteness”, and all manner of quirky, Adventure Time-esque shenanigans taking place throughout the course of the series.</p>

            <p><strong>The following text was written by Dominic Kelly</strong></p>
            
            
            <p>Let me tell you something about myself readers.

Ever since I was a little geek, I have loved to draw. Of all my passions, art is my first and foremost, and I’m rarely without a sketchbook of some kind when I’m out and about. So big is my love of art that I went to university to study animation, and I’m trained in the field as a result. That being said, I have also fallen into the trappings of everyday life; just those little things that stop you from drawing or keeps you from sitting down and working on something. It takes a considerable talent to just sit down and draw a simple five page comic, regardless of skill.</p>

<p>So you can probably imagine my surprise when I found a book, numbering 64 pages, was done by an eleven year old!</p>

<p>I mean, to sit down and commit time to such a large comic is impressive in itself. But the fact young Amy Tucker, who serves as both writer and artist no less, managed to undertake this feat at such a young age is beyond impressive. So with all that in mind, let’s talk about her debut book, Mystery Club Festival.</p>


<p>In Mystery Club Festival, we are introduced to our hero Amy Abnobotchi. A self described ‘a short tempered, self centred kid’ Amy doesn’t seem like your average hero. Along with her roommate and rival Professor Loco, the two find themselves whisked away to The Club Festival. While there though, they meet the mysterious Tiger Streak, and it seems strange goings may be afoot. Providing mystery, action, comedy and adventure, Mystery  Club promises to take its readers on a wild and fun filled ride.</p>

<p>I should get this out of the way right now folks; I wish I could draw or write this well when I was eleven. Heck I’m twenty six and still struggle with a lot of things. Taking to the medium with a natural grace, Amy’s work is pretty spectacular, especially considering this is her first outing into the world of comics. The writing is reminiscent to shows like Adventure Time and other’s you would find on the Cartoon Network. It’s a genuinely funny little story, full of heart and excitement, and is sure to bring a smile to your face. The art is also pretty excellent, and suits the writing perfectly. Fun and cute in equal measures, Amy’s work can only go up from here.</p>

<p>Mystery Club Festival is an absolute delight from beginning to end, and I can’t sing Amy Tucker’s praises enough. For eleven years old, if Amy stays the course, she has a very bright future in the world of comics and art. With some delightful art and writing, the comic is sure to delight people of all ages. What’s more, with issue two supposedly being released in the near future, I hope that a copy finds its way into Geek Retreat once more so I can keep reading.</p>

<p>So if you want a fun little story, be sure to check out Mystery Club Festival in the Geek Retreat free to read section. I’m sure you’ll find a good laugh within its pages.</p>

          <img class="img-responsive" src="images/news/amyGR.jpg"  alt="mystery club writer amy tucker">
           

<p>An enterprising East Kilbride schoolgirl has produced her own comic book ... which is now on sale. Talented Amy Tucker (11) from Calderwood, both wrote and drew all the art for her debut comic, Mystery Club.

The art-loving Maxwellton Primary pupil saved up the money herself to pay for the first print run of her comic and even has a website devoted to it.</p>

<p>Mystery Club is now being sold in Geek Retreat, Geek-a-boo and Waterstones.
  
  And plans are now in place for Amy to promote her comic at Waterstones in East Kilbride.
  
  Amy takes influence from Japanese manga art, which is used in pop-culture programmes like Pokemon and Dragonball Z and is a big fan of the ‘Calvin and Hobbes’ books and the Asterix stories.
  
  Amy’s proud mum, Angela, told the News: “She’s put a lot of work into this.
  
  “Amy has always enjoyed drawing and writing stories. She has been a fan of comic books since she was about seven.
  
  “She likes Japanese art, I’d say that’s her biggest influence.
  
  “We are really proud of her, she has done it all off her own back.
  
  “I took her into Glasgow and she talked to all the comic book shops and they were happy to sell them.
  
  “She really enjoys art, and comic book drawing is what she wants to do and, I think, it shows the quality of her drawings that these businesses are letting her into their stores.” </p>
